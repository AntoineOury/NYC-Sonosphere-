NYC Sonosphere is my Capstone project from NYU Shanghai (BSc Interactive Media Arts - 2023)

Website was made for mobile viewing! 

The project is a website documentation of my findings about localized and citywide sounds of New York City as well as a location-based AR map for people to find the sounds that I've covered in this project within the city.
