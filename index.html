        New York City Sonosphere is an interactive AR sound-walk project that
        takes you on an adventure around the city, exploring New York's unique
        and various sounds. The experience is flexible and compared to typical
        tours, doesn't requre you to follow the tracks linearly. The goal is for
        you to get a glimps of what New York's chaotic soundscape is and find
        beauty and appreciation in it by taking it apart.

        This project is the result of multiple months of research in areas of
        psychogeography, psychoacoustics, soudscapes, and acoustic communities
        (term coined by Barry Truax). From visiting different parts of NYC and
        sketching out acoustic maps of the sounds in those areas, I've noticed
        that the chaotic sounds of the city can create communities and a build a
        sense of familiarity and comfort. I've divided those sounds into two
        groups that both create acoustic communities but in different ways and
        ranges. The first most noticable and accessible to everyone (even people
        not from New York) are sounds that stretch across the whole city such as
        metro sounds, people walking and talking, as well as sounds of traffic.
        Those sounds travel and spread across NYC making most if not everyone
        familiar with them. The second type of sounds, more specific and harder
        to find when being an outsider to that accoustic community, are local
        sounds. By that I mean sounds that will only stretch across a small area
        like a few blocks such as the sound of water, skateboards, dogs, or
        music and more. Those sounds are more constrained by outside factors
        like weather, time, events surrounding its source, etc.
